# Event Driven Programming Session

Before the session attendees are expected to have some surface level awareness about:
- [Event-driven programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming)
- [Observer pattern](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-javascript-design/9781449334840/ch09s05.html)
- [Events in NodeJs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20MBBFZAmA)

## Objective of this exercise
Showcase how event-driven programming allows for decoupling among
entities. In no part of the code there will be: 

   - No references from one class into another.
   - No direct access of properties outside the class.

## What to focus on
- Relations between entities.
- Properties on each class.
- Events.
- Architecture.
