# JAVASCRIPT ADVANCED DISCUSSION GROUP
Join us for a round table of analyzing, critical thinking and creating with JavaScript! Think of this as a way to test everything you've learned so far and use creativity as a tool to deepen your fundamentals.
## Pre-requisites:
- JavaScript Track: JS130, Up to Testing
- Ruby Track: JS225
- Understand Bloom's [Taxonomy Launch School Presentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/launchschool/comments/kvf6pv/blooms_taxonomy_x_launch_school/), [General introduction](https://tophat.com/blog/blooms-taxonomy/) and [List of Questions](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/research/cwsei/resources/Blooms-verbs-stems.htm).
## Goals for the Group
- Practice problem solving collaboratively & intentionally
- Group programming
- Improve communication and teamwork
- Focus on levels 4,5 and 6 of the Taxonomy
## Guidelines for Participants
If you feel comfortable with a question, make space for others first, then help them fill their gaps
This is a space for everyone to contribute, participate, take risks, experiment,  to be open-minded to learning and LS Code of Conduct and Community Guidelines. 
## Guidelines for Leader
- Inform the group if you want to lead the session
- Weekly rotation of leaders
- Everyone should be the leader at least once
- Prepare a task for the group and additional questions and tasks to animate the group
- Know how to solve the task, how to get unstuck and don't give away the answer
### What kind of task to prepare:
- A challenging problem to solve
- A discussion topic
- A mini collaborative project
### Session Example
#### The session leader comes up with a topic or question for the group.
Example: 'Compare functions and classes (what are functions, what are classes? How are they related? How are they similar? How are they different?)'.
#### The group focuses on discussion
To answer this question, we would firstly need to recall the definitions of both classes and functions, then we would need to relate the knowledge we have about classes with what we know about functions. Then we would need to analyze, compare and find a relationship between them. Questions/tasks like that focus on: 'how?', 'why?', 'apply', 'analyze', 'compare' and 'what if?' instead of 'name', 'list', 'define'.
The group will take place every **Thursday at 12pm EST** (about 1h). The group is limited to 4 attendees, including the leader.  If you are interested in attending, comment below and let us know if you want to lead or just participate this time.
