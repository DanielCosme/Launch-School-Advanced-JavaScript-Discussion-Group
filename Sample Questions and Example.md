### Sample Questions
Use the following to start asking higher order thinking questions. The goal is to discuss, not to find an answer. By understanding the nuances, the learner demonstrates a clear undrestanding of tradeoffs in the chosen concept/field of exploration.

### Example Implementation
This example uses Object Creation Patterns in JavaScript.
| Bloom Level | Group questions examples|  
|-------------|--|
|Analyze| 1- Compare differences between OOLO and factory function object creation patterns. 2- How are objects that functions return, with private data, through closures differ from object creation patterns in general ? 3- Ask the group to prove their answers with code.
|Evaluate|1- Which object creation pattern would you choose for making a simple personal finance app. 2- Discuss tradeoffs in regards to IIFEs and closures for private data. |
|Create|1- Create a sketch/plan for this personal finance app by using what you know about Object Oriented JavaScript 2- Redo the solution in a different programming paradigm|
