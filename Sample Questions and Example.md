### Sample Questions
Use the following to start asking higher order thinking questions. The goal is to discuss, not to find an answer. By understanding the nuances, the learner demonstrates a clear undrestanding of tradeoffs in the chosen concept/field of exploration.

| **Analyze**     | What are the differences between...? Can you identify where the concept...? Relate how these two different implementations acheive... What are the potential problems of ...? |
| **Evaluate** | Do you agree with...?  How would you prove...?  Why did they choose...? Would it be better if....? How would you evaluate...? How could you determine...? What choice would you have made...? How would you prioritize...? Given a scenario, what's the BEST option?  | 
| **Create** | How would you plan...? What would you use to implement this feature...? How can we refactor...so that...?|

### Example Implementation
This example uses Object Creation Patterns in JavaScript.
| Bloom Level | Group questions examples|  
|-------------|--|
|Analyze| 1- Compare differences between OOLO and factory function object creation patterns. 2- How are objects that functions return, with private data, through closures differ from object creation patterns in general ? 3- Ask the group to prove their answers with code.
|Evaluate|1- Which object creation pattern would you choose for making a simple personal finance app. 2- Discuss tradeoffs in regards to IIFEs and closures for private data. |
|Create|1- Create a sketch/plan for this personal finance app by using what you know about Object Oriented JavaScript 2- Redo the solution in a different programming paradigm|
